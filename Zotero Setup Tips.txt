Instructions:
- Log in Zotero Sync (username/pass)
- On Settings > Advanced > Files and Folders: Add the base folder (Local Dropbox).
	- This will sync every file 
- Still on Settings > General: Open PDFs using: System Default
- Download ZotFile (Extension)
- Set up "Location of Files" to "Custom Location": Dropbox\ZoteroAttachments 
	- Which moves all your files to a single folder (Which is synced with Dropbox)
	- I recommend setting up subfolder as well: E.g. /%c (to sort by Collection)
- View Menu -> Show Items from SubCollections
